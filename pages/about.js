				<h1>My Story</h1>
				<p>
					Hi, there! I am a self-taught web developer who is fluent in
					JavaScript and has experience writing Python script. I grew
					up in Hong Kong and attended university in the United
					States, majoring in English Education. Upon my graduation,
					Iâ€™ve worked as an Engish tutor in two different local
					education companies.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>
					While working as an English tutor, I learned that it is
					possible to improve my teaching and solve some of my
					students' problems through technology, and that discovery
					led me to start learning how to code. So, I learned how to
					develop web applications by using online resources and
					taking onlince courses.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>
					In May 2021, I made the decision to make a career change and
					started freelancing as a web developer. As a self-taught
					programmer, I'm used to quickly picking up new languages and
					technologies, and I'm eager to learn continuously. Despite
					my lack of a formal degree in Computer Science, I have taken
					several programming courses online which helps me understand
					the fundamental of computer science and the importance of
					correctness and design in code.
